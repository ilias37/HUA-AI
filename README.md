Project implemented for the course "Artificial Intelligence" in the sixth semester of my studies.

Python 3.6 is required in order to "run" the `autograder.py` file and display the grade of the assignment. 

In each assignment there is an `assignmnet.pdf` file which tells what each assignment implements.
